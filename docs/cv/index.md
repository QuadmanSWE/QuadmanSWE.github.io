## High tech industry

I designed a SQL Server database application and set up the pipeline to get development rolling.

## Saxo Bank
### Data Warehouse Development

`2017-2018`

I worked as a contractor in a larger team of senior developers. Working in short sprints and with continuous integration through a rigorous process I could work alone on all manner of tasks from the backlog.
I’ve worked for example with restructuring and partitioning large clustered columnstore indexes, documenting and automating ETL-patterns and parts of development itself. I also worked on performance tuning and had to coordinate different teams and systems in incident management.



## JBT Corporation
### SQL Server Migration

`2017`

My employer at the time was hired to migrate SQL Server from 2000 to 2016 and to put guidelines in place for a better operations in the future. I was in charge of solving how SSRS could go from Sharepoint 2003 integrated mode to SSRS 2016 Native. I constructed a suitable path and also built a testing framework for automated report testing for different versions of SQL Server to both test our upgrade path but also isolate any version change bugs or undesired changes.



## Region Skåne
### Invoicing system for health care

`2013-2017`
I held a key role in a complete rework of the invoicing engine for healthcare in Skåne. The new system is controlled through metadata instead of schema changes to address changes over time in the governing contracts of health care in the region. This project made sure that the on staff personnel could perform the duties of the system rather than needing an external contractor while upholding greater levels of speed, results insight, and control. I was also responsible for the integration to a handful of BI-related systems on different platforms.



## High-technology engineering group 
### High speed IoT-solution for Research and Development of industry equipment
`2015`

Me and a colleague built a solution to model, store, and in real time analyze streams of data from sensors on equipment in a workshop with thirty measures at up to twenty-thousand times a second. The solution also covered communication back to the equipment at programmable events in the data stream, a graphical user interface for the analysts and operators of the equipment, and a Data Warehouse for permanent storage.

(Details of this client and the nature of their research is still under NDA)



## Sandvik IT Services
### Implementation of Forefront Identity Manager 

`2011-2012`

I have built a Data Warehouse together with a complete ETL process for internal invoicing of IT-Services. The DW is used by business analysts. The assignment also included management and further development of an SSIS solution to automate the update of a CMDB (configuration management database) from roughly ten sources. I persuaded management to include a pre-production environment to guarantee uptime in production which also helped the testing of new changes and set a welcome new precedent in the organization.


## Sandvik IT Services
### Data Warehouse development and administration

`2011-2012`

I had a supporting role in a project concerning life-cycle management of personnel while working for Sandvik It Services. I worked on creating procedures, agents, and solutions tailored for integration to HR-systems, Active Directory and the E-mail solution at the time (Lotus Notes). The system’s primary function is to synchronize user-objects throughout their respective life-cycles and can provision or remove ad-accounts, email-accounts and group memberships when objects are created/updated/removed in the HR-system. I also helped out in the HR-system to make sure that the integration conformed to best practices on both ends. Lastly I built a smaller data mart with simple reports to help out with monitoring of the system during its initial roll-out.



## Carnero
### Systems developer and database administrator

`2008-2010`
I worked with building ERP-systems on the ATAIO framework meaning a lot of our business logic resided in a database. This is where I learned and got interested in data modeling and automation. My primary assignments were to, given a description of the customers operation, leveraging close contact with key personnel, to develop a tailored ERP and CRM system that covered everything that was needed in day to day operations. In the assignment I also carried out the final implementation of a new system and the education for the end-users. The applications incorporated SSRS for different kinds of documents such as invoices to end-customers and dashboards for KPIs to be used internally.
I also built a complete salary engine that connects time-reporting to payroll through a sophisticated layer of matrices governed by agreements in the hiring of each employee.
